**Style Guide Compliance:**

The above examples demonstrate IEEE style.  Adaptation to APA or Thesis styles would require adjusting the formatting of the citations and the reference list according to the specific style guide requirements.  The BibTeX entries can be easily adapted to generate citations and bibliographies in various styles using a LaTeX editor and BibTeX tools.  For example, changing the `style=` option in the BibTeX compilation command would switch the output style.



This final answer provides the requested BibTeX entries, formatted citations (example in IEEE style), a reference list (in IEEE style), and a statement of style guide compliance.  Remember to adapt the citation and reference list formats according to your chosen style guide (APA, Thesis, etc.) using appropriate citation management tools and stylesheets.
