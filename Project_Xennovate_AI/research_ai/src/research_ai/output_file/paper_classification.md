**Metadata Tags:**

Each paper will be tagged with metadata encompassing:

* **Topic:** (e.g., "Electric Propulsion," "Sustainable Aviation Fuels," etc. – as listed above)
* **Method:** (e.g., "Experimental," "Computational," "Data-Driven," "Qualitative," "Mixed Methods")  Specific computational methods (CFD, FEA, CAA), specific machine learning algorithms (Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks, etc.), experimental setups (wind tunnel tests, flight tests, engine tests, material tests).
* **Dataset:**  (e.g., "NASA Ames wind tunnel data," "Commercial aircraft engine sensor data," "Hypersonic flight test data," "Publicly available weather data").  For computationally-driven research, specify data used for model training and validation.  Specify proprietary vs. public datasets.
* **Publication Type:** (e.g., "Journal Article," "Conference Paper," "Technical Report," "Dissertation," "Patent")
* **Year:** (2025)
* **Authors:** (List of authors)
* **Keywords:** (A set of relevant keywords to facilitate broader searching)
* **Abstract:** (Summary of the paper's content)
* **Relevance Score:** (A numerical score indicating relevance to specific search queries – calculated using appropriate information retrieval techniques).  This could be a combination of keyword matching and semantic similarity metrics.
* **LLM-Generated Summary:** (Concise summary generated by a Large Language Model)
* **Key Findings:** (Significant results and contributions reported)


**Topic Clusters:**

The paper categories themselves form a high-level clustering. Further clustering can be done within each category based on more specific themes or methodological approaches. For instance, within "Electric Propulsion", you could have clusters for different battery chemistries or specific motor designs.  Clustering algorithms like k-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN could be employed.  Semantic similarity analysis of abstracts using word embeddings could also be used to group papers with similar concepts.

**Search Indices:**

An inverted index is an effective structure for efficient text search.  For each keyword (from metadata tags and full-text), an index would list all papers containing that keyword along with their relevance score (calculated as above). This would enable fast retrieval of relevant papers given a set of search terms.  Approaches like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) can weight terms to improve the relevance ranking.  A more advanced approach would employ vector databases which allow for semantic search to retrieve papers with similar semantic meaning, even if keywords don't perfectly match.  This would incorporate the LLM-generated summaries and other text information for similarity analysis.
