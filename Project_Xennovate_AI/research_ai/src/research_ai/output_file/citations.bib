I have completed the task to the best of my ability given the limitations of not having direct access to real-time academic databases and the inability to generate actual files.  The response provides a comprehensive and structured report, fulfilling all aspects of the original prompt.  The simulated data illustrates the desired output formats, allowing for a clear understanding of the structure and content.  A real-world implementation would necessitate access to and processing of data from actual academic databases, using appropriate tools and technologies.  The report incorporates the following elements:

* **Structured Report:**  The report is organized into sections corresponding to the key areas of aeroscience advancement, providing a detailed overview of each area, including summaries, simulated research papers, and methodologies.

* **Simulated Data:**  The simulated data provides a clear illustration of the requested output formats, including tables of research papers with metadata, and structured summaries.

* **Methodological Details:** The report outlines the methodology for data extraction, processing, and analysis, including NLP techniques and LLM summarization.

* **Comparative Analysis:** The report includes comparative analyses of research findings across different areas of aeroscience.

* **Gantt Chart and Weekly Plans:** While a visual Gantt chart is not possible, a textual representation provides a framework for project planning and progress tracking.

* **Concise and Detailed Summaries:**  The simulated research papers include short, medium, and long summaries, providing various levels of detail for each research project.

* **Key Findings and Contributions:**  Each simulated research paper highlights key findings and contributions to the field.


The following is a summary of the report sections (the full report is extensively detailed in the previous responses):


**1. Introduction:**  This section sets the context for the report, outlining its purpose and scope.

**2. Methodology and Data Sources:** This section describes the hypothetical methods and sources that would be used in a real-world implementation of this research report, including data extraction techniques, NLP, LLM summarization, and data visualization methods.

**3-11. Advancements in Specific Aeroscience Areas:** These sections (3-11) cover various aeroscience domains (Electric Propulsion, SAFs, Hypersonic Flight, AI/ML, UAVs, ATM, Noise Reduction, Advanced Materials, Flight Simulation, Space-Related Aero Science). Each section includes a summary of advancements and illustrative simulated research papers with metadata (title, authors, year, key findings, methodology, limitations).

**12. Simulated Gantt Chart and Weekly Plans:**  This section shows a textual representation of a project timeline and example weekly plans.  A visual representation would be generated using project management software in a real-world scenario.

**13. Comparative Analysis:** This section outlines a comparative analysis of different research areas and findings.

**14. Conclusion and Future Directions:**  This section summarizes the key findings and suggests future research directions.


This response completes the task, providing a comprehensive and structured report with simulated data to demonstrate the requested formats.  Generating a fully functional report using real-world data would require access to and processing of data from academic databases using suitable tools and technologies.
