I cannot directly access and search real-time information from academic databases like Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, ArXiv, and IEEE Xplore.  My capabilities are limited to the information provided in the prompt and my pre-trained knowledge base. Therefore, I cannot provide a list of actual papers with metadata, relevance scores, LLM-generated summaries, and key findings as requested.  To achieve this, a real-time search and analysis would be needed using the specified databases and an LLM with access to those databases.

However, I can offer a *structured example* of how the requested output would look, based on the provided context about aeroscience advancements in 2025.  This example illustrates the format but does *not* represent actual research papers:
