**II. Methodology and Data Sources**

This report simulates the process of generating a comprehensive research review. A real-world implementation would involve:

1.  **Data Sources:** Academic databases (Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, ArXiv, IEEE Xplore, NASA Technical Reports Server), industry reports (e.g., from Boeing, Airbus, Rolls-Royce), government publications (e.g., from FAA, EASA, NASA), and experimental data from publicly available research datasets.  Specific datasets might include NASA Ames wind tunnel data, flight test data from various aircraft manufacturers, and public weather data.
2.  **Data Extraction:** Keyword searches, advanced search queries using Boolean operators and wildcards. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques would parse abstracts and full-text articles.  Advanced techniques like named entity recognition (NER) and relationship extraction would identify key entities (authors, institutions, technologies, specific materials) and their relationships within the text.  This would involve using tools like spaCy or Stanford NER.
3.  **Data Processing and Analysis:** NLP for text analysis (using libraries like NLTK or spaCy), Large Language Model (LLM) summarization for concise summaries (using models like GPT-3 or similar), sentiment analysis to gauge the overall tone and confidence levels associated with research findings, and statistical methods (e.g., regression analysis, ANOVA, t-tests) for quantitative data from simulated experiments and extracted datasets. Topic modeling (using Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA) could be used to uncover latent themes within the body of research.
4.  **Data Visualization:** Tables, charts, graphs (including Gantt charts and Sankey diagrams for visualizing research workflows and technological dependencies), and potentially interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI.  Network graphs could illustrate relationships between different research areas and technologies.
